# Stability & Accuracy of Radiomic Features

## 1) Download and prepare data for feature extraction
### Download
In a first step, the two datasets these experiments are based on must be downloaded and stored in the right directories so the code can access them.
Both datasets are publicly available on The Cancer Imaging Archive's website.

Download CT-Phantom4Radiomics data from here: [CTP4R](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/ct-phantom4radiomics/)  
Download Colorectal-Liver-Metastases data from here: [CRLM](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/colorectal-liver-metastases/)

### Directories
The scans and segmentation data must be moved into the designated directories in ...  
A script to move the data is provided. Insert the paths where the data is stored and run the script.
